## Project Name: 
Milestone Project 1 - Full Stack Web Developer

## Project Overview: 
The web-site offers a potential recruiter: 
i) An insight into my coding capabilities  
ii) A framework for Business Problem Solving 

The site is easy to navigate and follows a logical flow of information about myself and my abilities. Within the body of the site (in the 'Adding Value' section), 
the user is provided with links to additional pages which build on the concept of having a ready-made framework for addressing problems faced by most organisations. 

## UX
I designed the web site primarily with recruiters in mind. I also wanted to be able to demonstrate that I could offer more than full-stack web design capability. 
Solving business problems is something I've been responsible for in various roles over the years, and I wanted to be able to show that I could combine my years of 
professional experience with that of web development and design. Working with leaders to understand their business challenges and needs, and offering a solution 
through full-stack web development greatly appeals to me. I'd like to use this project (and web-site) to promote my abilities in both these areas. 

The following wireframes provide the insight and logic into the design and purpose of the site: 
** p1. The inroduction page provides links in the header to other areas that provide information about me, my background and how I (and the website) bring value to someone's organisation. 
** p2. Provides a couple of paragraphs with introductory summaries of the technical skills and services I offer, along with my picture. 
** p3. Offers more detailed information on my work historty with a timeline, and a list of my main (relevant) qualifications. I also provide a couple of 
brief paragraphs about my back-end and front-end capabilities. 
** p4. This section summarises my approach to business problem solving, and introduces the concept of structuring all busines sproblems through six business values. 
These values are listed, with links in each which take the user to a serapate page where more detailed information can be provided and submitted as a query. 
** p5. This last section offers the user an opportunity to submit a general query - not specific to any one of the six values noted in the prior section. 
** p6. This page provides the frame for all of the six additional pages that the user can access via the links in the 'six businss values' section. 

## Features
The main feature of the site is the approach to business problem solving, through the six business values. Each of the six additional pages (Leadership, 
Clients, Financials, Quality, Efficiency, People) offers the user 3 specific examples (thorugh 'buttons') of the problems they might be trying to resolve. 
An 'all options' button is also available. 

The user is asked to select one of the buttons available on each of the six pages, and to then provide their contact information and project description information. 
Once they submit that information, I'd then contact them to discuss further. 

Additional (future) features might include:
* Links to additonal / related information to that particular business problem 
* Additonal 'buttons' providing the user with more options to select at this initial stage
* Examples of problems solved for other clietns within each of these six business value areas 

## Technologies Used
** html: the base language used to build the web-site
** css: to simplify the format and layout of the web pages by enhancing the code in the html pages 
** bootstrap: so that I could use ready-made design templates to enhance the front-end appearance and user-experience of the web-site 
** W3 Schools online web tutorials: https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp : I found this useful when looking for alternative descriptions and solutions to bootstrap. 

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
