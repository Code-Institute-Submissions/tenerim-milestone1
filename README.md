## Project Name: 
Milestone Project 1 - Full Stack Web Developer

## Project Overview: 
The web-site offers a potential recruiter: 
i) An insight into my coding capabilities  
ii) A framework for Business Problem Solving 

The site is easy to navigate and follows a logical flow of information about myself and my abilities. Within the body of the site (in the 'Adding Value' section), 
the user is provided with links to additional pages which build on the concept of having a ready-made framework for addressing problems faced by most organisations. 

## UX
I designed the web site primarily with recruiters in mind. I also wanted to be able to demonstrate that I could offer more than full-stack web design capability. 
Solving business problems is something I've been responsible for in various roles over the years, and I wanted to be able to show that I could combine my years of 
professional experience with that of web development and design. Working with leaders to understand their business challenges and needs, and offering a solution 
through full-stack web development greatly appeals to me. I'd like to use this project (and web-site) to promote my abilities in both these areas. 

The following wireframes provide the insight and logic into the design and purpose of the site: https://github.com/tenerim/milestone1/tree/master/wireframes 
* p1. The inroduction page provides links in the header to other areas that provide information about me, my background and how I (and the website) bring value to someone's organisation. 
* p2. Provides a couple of paragraphs with introductory summaries of the technical skills and services I offer, along with my picture. 
* p3. Offers more detailed information on my work historty with a timeline, and a list of my main (relevant) qualifications. I also provide a couple of 
brief paragraphs about my back-end and front-end capabilities. 
* p4. This section summarises my approach to business problem solving, and introduces the concept of structuring all busines sproblems through six business values. 
These values are listed, with links in each which take the user to a serapate page where more detailed information can be provided and submitted as a query. 
* p5. This last section offers the user an opportunity to submit a general query - not specific to any one of the six values noted in the prior section. 
* p6. This page provides the frame for all of the six additional pages that the user can access via the links in the 'six businss values' section. 

## Features
The main feature of the site is the approach to business problem solving through the six business values. Each of the six additional pages (Leadership, 
Clients, Financials, Quality, Efficiency, People) offers the user 3 specific examples of the problems they might be trying to resolve. 
The user can select any one of the three problems shown on the page, to help provide feedback to me on what they'd like my help with. An 'all options' button is also available. 

The user is asked to select one of theese buttons available on each of the six pages, and to then provide their contact information and project description information. 
Once they submit that information, I'd then contact them to discuss further. 

Additional (future) features might include:
* Links to additonal external sites which provide related information to that particular business problem 
* Additonal 'buttons' providing the user with more options to select at this initial stage
* Examples of problems which I previously solved for other clients within each of these six business value areas 

## Technologies Used
* html: the base language used to build the web-site
* css: to simplify the format and layout of the web pages by enhancing the code in the html pages 
* bootstrap: so that I could use ready-made design templates to enhance the front-end appearance and user-experience of the web-site 
* W3 Schools online web tutorials: https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp : I found this useful when looking for alternative descriptions and solutions to bootstrap. 

## Testing
All my testing was completed manually. The specific steps taken are listed below: 
* I reloaded each page once I completed a new section.
* Once I was confident with that view, I opened the page in the browser and ran the page in that view. 
* The 'submit' buttons do not take the user to an alternative site, and they do not provide me with the information the user populates in the 'Project description' section. This will be developed at a later date. 
* I also tested my website on the different scren sizes where I was able to correct any errors or inconsistencies by adjusting for the column widths within each container.
* This also ensured the text aligned appropriately for the screen size chosen.
